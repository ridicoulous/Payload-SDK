## What is the DJI Payload SDK?

The DJI Payload SDK(PSDK), is a development kit provided by DJI to support developers to develop payload that can be
mounted on DJI drones. Combined with the X-Port, SkyPort or extension port adapter, developers can obtain the
information or other resource from the drone. According to the software logic and algorithm framework designed by the
developer, users could develop payload that can be mounted on DJI Drone, to perform actions they need, such as Automated
Flight Controller, Payload Controller, Video Image Analysis Platform, Mapping Camera, Megaphone And Searchlight, etc.
